## üß© Notes & Best Practices

* For large tenants, use paging or throttling with `Get-MgDeviceManagementManagedDevice`.
* To automate without interaction, register an **Azure App** and use certificate or secret auth.
* Clean any remaining tenant-specific strings before public publishing.
* Review output CSVs for any sensitive identifiers before sharing.
