# Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep this project and its users safe.  
This document explains how to **responsibly report security issues or sensitive data exposure** related to this repository.

## üîí Overview

This repository contains **sanitized PowerShell scripts** designed for public sharing and learning.  
Although all files have been reviewed to remove company or personal identifiers, we still take potential data leaks seriously.

If you find **any credential, domain, identifier, or potentially sensitive string**, please report it privately as described below.

---

## üì¨ Reporting a Security Issue

If you discover a vulnerability or believe sensitive information has been committed:

1. **Do not create a public GitHub Issue or Pull Request.**  
   This prevents accidental disclosure.

2. Instead, please contact the maintainer directly:  
   **Email:** `explicitcontent231@gmail.com` 

3. Include:
   - A description of what you found  
   - The affected file or commit SHA  
   - Steps to reproduce or verify (if applicable)

You‚Äôll receive an acknowledgment within **48 hours**, and follow-up communication until the issue is resolved.

## üßπ Sanitization & Privacy Practices

All scripts in this repository have undergone sanitization using the included tool:
- **`Sanitize-Scripts.ps1`** replaces sensitive data with placeholders.
- Mappings are logged to `.mapping.json` and `.mapping.csv` for verification.
- Public domains such as `microsoft.com` and `github.com` are whitelisted.

Before committing or contributing any code:
- **Always run the sanitizer** to ensure no company-specific or personal data remains.
- **Review mappings** to verify replacements are correct.
- **Check logs** for any uncaught tokens, URLs, or identifiers.

If you discover missed data in any public script, please report it immediately using the email above.

## üõ†Ô∏è Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

Please:
- Provide enough detail to reproduce the issue.
- Allow reasonable time for remediation before public disclosure.
- Avoid accessing or modifying data beyond what is necessary for proof-of-concept.

We will publicly acknowledge contributors who responsibly disclose security issues, if they consent.

## üß© Non-Security Reports

For general issues (bugs, enhancements, documentation), please open a [GitHub Issue](../../issues) rather than a security report.

## ü™™ License & Warranty

This repository is provided under the [MIT License](LICENSE).  
All scripts are distributed **as-is**, without warranty.  
The maintainer and contributors are not responsible for misuse or modification of this code in production environments.
